### Description:
This Program makes use of a Maze.txt file to create custom rooms, paths and items which a Player can interact with through a Command Line Interface.  Right now the game is just a template which can be built into a full-blown CLI adventure game with graphic interface.

### Instructions:
In its current state the game will run in a terminal window, open the solution and build to see output.
